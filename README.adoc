= Simple example of how to use GStreamer's qmlglsink

This is a simple application that starts a Qt5 QML interface and plays a video in a QML item.
That QML item is the GLVideoItem that is registered by GStreamer's https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/qmlgl/qmlglsink.html[qmlglsink].
It uses a basic playbin based pipeline.

To build it, run:

    make build
    qmake ..
    make

This produces a `qmlglsink-example` binary. Use the `--help` switch to get a list of valid options.
